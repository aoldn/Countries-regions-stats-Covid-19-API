# API is for:
developers, machines, programs, and other websites to be able to quickly fetch up to date rates on the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe.
The API returns live cases, vaccination, historical data and culculated monthly rates. This culculated and raw data can be used to build tools and systems that are used for data analysis all the way to websites that act as public dashboards and charts.

# How to use API: 

- Cases data on specific country 
Example request:  Get /cases/United Kingdom
- Cases data on specific country and region of that country 
#Example request:  Get /cases/Germany/Bayern
