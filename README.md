The API is intended for developers, machines, programs, and other websites to be able to quickly fetch up to date information on the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe.
The API returns live cases, vaccination, historical data and culculated monthly rates. This culculated and row data can be used to build tools and systems that are used for data analysis all the way to websites that act as public dashboards and charts.
